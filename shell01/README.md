# Shell01

I did not submit this one for evaluation because I just wanted to move on to c projects and I saw that most of the others did not work on this either. I thought I would probably get back to work on this but did not have the time nor the eval points.

Notes:
1. ex04 is a bit weird because i could only test it on my own system. other system might have different output.
2. IIRC, ex05 would need the echo command to write inside the file without opening it. What difference would it make? I don't know.
