# C02

This one took the longest of all.

- [x] ex00	ft_strcpy
- [x] ex01	ft_strncpy
- [x] ex02	ft_str_is_alpha
- [x] ex03	ft_str_is_numeric
- [x] ex04	ft_str_is_lowercase
- [x] ex05	ft_str_is_uppercase
- [x] ex06	ft_str_is_printable
- [x] ex07	ft_strupcase
- [x] ex08	ft_strlowcase
- [x] ex09	ft_strcapitalize
- [ ] ex10	ft_strlcpy - **KO**
- [x] ex11	ft_putstr_non_printable
- [ ] ex12	ft_print_memory	- **no submission**

Notes:
1. ex09 was really problematic because I didn't really pay enough attention to the details.
2. ex10 didn't pass. I was not sure how to make sense of the real function.
3. ex11 passed though.
