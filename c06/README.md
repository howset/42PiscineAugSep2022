# C06

This one was quick. First time dealing with parameters/arguments for the main function.

- [x] ex00	ft_print_program_name
- [x] ex01	ft_print_params
- [x] ex02	ft_rev_params
- [ ] ex03	ft_sort_params

Notes:
1. Could probably have invested more time on ex03, but I decided to just move on. Which was probably not the best idea.
