# Rush00

The first rush project, and the only rush that I think I could do. I actually thought we did quite well. We managed to find an idea pretty quickly, managed to get it working only a short while later. We then move on to tackle the other variants. Even got so far as making a shell script to run them all at once. Alas, the auto-check norminette failed us due to a tab on an empty space.

Notes:
1. Run the shell script with the dimension as arguments (x,y). Otherwise the default is (5,5).

```shell
./loopover.sh 6 10
```
