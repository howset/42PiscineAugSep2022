# C01

This one took quite sometime to do.

Notes:
1. Probably due to the fact that I have to invest some time to learn about pointers.
2. ~~I dont really remember, but either ex07 or ex08 didn't pass moulinette.~~ ex06 failed, probably due to ignoring the null terminator, ex07 did not compile, ex08 passed.
