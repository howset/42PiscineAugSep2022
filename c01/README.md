# C01

This one took quite sometime to do.

- [x] ex00	ft_ft
- [x] ex01	ft_ultimate_ft
- [x] ex02	ft_swap
- [x] ex03	ft_div_mod	
- [x] ex04	ft_ultimate_div_mod
- [x] ex05	ft_putstr
- [ ] ex06	ft_strlen - **KO**
- [ ] ex07	ft_rev_int_tab - **does not compile**
- [x] ex08	ft_sort_int_tab

Notes:
1. Probably due to the fact that I have to invest some time to learn about pointers.
2. ~~I dont really remember, but either ex07 or ex08 didn't pass moulinette.~~ ex06 failed, probably due to ignoring the null terminator, ex07 did not compile, ex08 passed.
