# C05

Recursion is definitely an awesome thing, but very difficult to wrap my head around. Spent hours just to get a line of code.

- [x] ex00	ft_iterative_factorial
- [x] ex01	ft_recursive_factorial
- [x] ex02	ft_iterative_power
- [x] ex03	ft_recursive_power
- [x] ex04	ft_fibonacci
- [x] ex05	ft_sqrt
- [x] ex06	ft_is_prime
- [x] ex07	ft_is_next_prime
- [ ] ex08	ft_ten_queens_puzzle

Notes:
1. ex05 is frustrating. My version runs really fast, but moulinette timed me out anyway. So I fixed it by copying someone else's code that includes a harcoded limit.
2. ex07 failed because I had a typo on the filename. But should work.
