# C05

Recursion is definitely an awesome thing, but very difficult to wrap my head around. Spent hours just to get a line of code.

Notes:
1. ex05 is frustrating. My version runs really fast, but moulinette timed me out anyway. So I fixed it by copying someone else's code that includes a harcoded limit.
2. ex07 failed because I had a typo on the filename. But should work.
