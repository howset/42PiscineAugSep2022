# C07

One frustration after another. This was nearing the final exam. And failed for three times.

Notes:
1. ex01 maybe has problems with the array length. but printingthe array on the terminal seems to indicate that nothing is wrong.
2. ex02 is very similar to ex01, so I also dont know what is wrong here.
3. ex03 seems to be very flawed. See if i have the time to get back to it.
