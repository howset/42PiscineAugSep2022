# C07

This is all about malloc. One frustration after another. This was nearing the final exam. And failed for three times. 

- [x] ex00	ft_strdup
- [x] ex01	ft_range
- [ ] ex02	ft_ultimate_range  - **done**
- [ ] ex03	ft_strjoin - **done**
- [ ] ex04	ft_convert_base
- [ ] ex05	ft_split

Notes:
1. ex01 maybe has problems with the array length. but printing the array on the terminal seems to indicate that nothing is wrong.
2. ex02 is very similar to ex01, so I also dont know what is wrong here.
3. ex03 seems to be very flawed. See if I have the time to get back to it.
