# C00

This one was done pretty quickly.

- [x] ex00	ft_putchar
- [x] ex01	ft_print_alphabet
- [x] ex02	ft_print_reverse_alphabet
- [x] ex03	ft_print_numbers
- [x] ex04	ft_is_negative
- [x] ex05	ft_print_comb
- [x] ex06	ft_print_comb2
- [ ] ex07	ft_putnbr - **KO**
- [ ] ex08	ft_print_combn - **no submission**

Notes:
1. ex07 didn't pass. I learned later that this is due to the fact that the code was tested with min int as an input. Fixed this later on c04.
