# C08

The last one I managed to work on before the final exam. Seems like a big undertaking to get into a whole new topic, but in fact it's not that difficult. Some online introduction articles for header files, include guards, and structs seem to suffice. 

- [x] ex00	ft.h
- [x] ex01	ft_boolean.h
- [x] ex02	ft_abs.h
- [x] ex03	ft_point.h
- [ ] ex04	ft_strs_to_tab
- [ ] ex05	ft_show_tab	

Notes:
1. ex04, and subsequently ex05 didn't pass. Probably due to the strdup function that has to be more optimized regarding the null termination. Maybe. Don't know though.
