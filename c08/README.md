# C08

The last one I managed to work on before the final exam. Seems like a big undertaking to get into a whole new topic, but in fact it's not that difficult. Some online introduction articles for header files, include guards, and structs seem to suffice. 

Notes:
1. ex04, and subsequently ex05 didn't pass. Probably due to the strdup function that has to be more optimized regarding the null termination. Maybe. Don't know though.
