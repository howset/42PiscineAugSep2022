# C03

I like this one somehow.

- [x] ex00	ft_strcmp
- [x] ex01	ft_strncmp
- [x] ex02	ft_strcat
- [x] ex03	ft_strncat
- [x] ex04	ft_strstr
- [ ] ex05	ft_strlcat - **KO**

Notes:
1. ex05 didn't pass. Still have no idea what the real function wants to do. Like in c02.
2. If my understanding is correct, then the function already does what it's supposed to do, but the problem probably lies in how to null terminate the resulting string.
